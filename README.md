# Combining different API's together

Here we will look at how we can combine the data from different API's together to make useful functionalities for a product. 

## Our example

Our example will be an Arduino Device which can tell us when we need to leave the house to catch our train for work or school that day. We are going to be working with the NodeMCU with ESP-8266 and make a LED shine when we need to leave.

### What do we need for this to work?

#### Hardware
- NodeMCU

#### Software
- [NS API](https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-api)
- [Zapier Account](https://zapier.com/)
