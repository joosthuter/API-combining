# Creating an alarm for your morning commute

We are gonna be creating an Arduino that will tell you when you need to leave in time to catch your train. We are going to be using the [NS API](https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-api) to tell the arduino when our train is leaving and we're going to be using  [Zapier Account](https://zapier.com/) to connect our Google Calendar to the device.

### How will this work

With [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) we'll make sure that our Arduino gets a notification when you have an appointment set in your calendar. 

### What do we need for this to work?

#### Hardware
- NodeMCU

#### Software
- [NS API](https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-api)
- [Zapier Account](https://zapier.com/)
